# Server extension || Digital Design

- This is my educational project which I have made during .Net/C# courses at the [Digital Design](https://digdes.ru/) company. 
- I supported a digital document management product and wrote server extensions for the Docsvision client.
- I worked on my first big project. I gained teamwork and soft skills. I learned about microservice architecture style.
